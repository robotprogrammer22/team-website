      <p>
        In 1999, Team 60 played at two events. At the NASA Ames Regional at
        Moffet Field in California, Team 60 received the “Most Photogenic”
        award. They later traveled to Orlando Florida and competed at the
        National Championship where they placed 86th.
      </p>

      <p>
        The competition “Double Trouble” was played by two alliances at a time,
        with each alliance composed of two teams. Points were scored by
        positioning “floppies,” robots, and the “puck” on the playing field.
        Floppies are lightweight, pillow-like objects with Velcro-loop material
        located in the center and around the perimeter. Each alliance has ten
        color coded floppies located on the playing field and at the player
        stations. At the end of each two minute match, points were awarded as
        follows: Each two-team alliance receives one point for each of its
        floppies that is at least 2” over and not touching the playing field
        surface, and less than eight feet above the surface if the playing
        field. Each alliance receives three points for each of its floppies
        eight feet or higher over the surface of the playing field. Any robot
        that climbs onto the puck will multiply its alliance’s score by three.
