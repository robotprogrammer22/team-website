        1998 was the second year for Team 60. The Kingman High School robotics
        club increased in size to 37 students traveling. Teacher Adam Sears was
        the coach of the team. Glenn Thoroughman and others from Laron
        Engineering provided mentoring for the team.
      </p>

      <p>
        Team 60 competed at the World Championship at Walt Disney World Epcot
        Center in Orlando Florida. The team and their “bionic bulldog” robot
        performed well and placed 41st in the seeding matches among over 100
        other teams.

        The Ladder Logic competition was played with three teams at a time on a
        hexagon shaped field. In two minutes matches, the three robots and human
        players scored points by placing the balls onto the side goals or into
        the central goal. The color-coding of the balls was used to identify
        team ownership. A human player, located outside the perimeter of the
        field, was allowed to hand balls to the robot or throw balls directly at
        the goals.
