        The year 2000 was a remarkable year for Team 60. At the NASA Ames
        Regional in California, the team outperformed all the other teams during
        qualification matches to become the #1 seed for playoffs. Team 60 then
        went on to win the Regional where about 40 teams competed. Alliance
        members included The Cheesy Poofs(254) and Team 409. Team 60 also
        received the Quality Award at the regional.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the National Championship in Orlando Florida, Team 60 continued to
        perform well and earned the #5 seed for playoffs out of 250 teams.

        In the competition game “Co-opertition FIRST”, four teams, paired in two
        alliances, will compete in each match. An alliance scores points by
        placing balls in their goal, and by positioning their robots in
        designated areas at the end of each match. At the start of a match each
        alliance has seven yellow balls and one black ball in their station. In
        addition, there are fifteen yellow balls and two black balls on the far
        side of the field which may be scored by either alliance.
