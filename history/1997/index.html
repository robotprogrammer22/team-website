        The Toroid Terror competition was played with three teams at a time on a
        hexagon shaped field. In two minute matches, three robots and human
        players scored points by placing the inner tubes onto pegs in the goal,
        or around the top of the goal. The tubes were color-coded to identify
        team ownership. Human players were not allowed onto the field, but they
        were allowed to hand tubes to the robots or throw tubes directly onto
        the goal.

        Major sponsors included the Mohave Generating Station and Ford Motor
        Company. The students also raised money through car washes held at Taco
        Bell.
