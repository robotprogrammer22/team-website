<h1><strong><span class="auto-style5"><span class="auto-style6">About <em>FIRST</em> 
Team 60!</span></span></strong></h1>
<p class="auto-style1"><strong>Team 60 strives to achieve the greatest by working as one single unit. This allows for maximum effectiveness and stability within our club. We have grown from a single High School Team in 1996 to a community team composed of students from <a href="http://khs.kusd.org/">Kingman High School</a>, <a href="http://kaolaz.org/">Kingman Academy of Learning (KAOL)</a>, <a href="http://lwhs.kusd.org/"> Lee Williams High School</a>, home-schooled and K-12 Virtual Academy. Our goal is continue to promote the concepts of 
<em>FIRST</em> (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) throughout every elementary and middle school in the Kingman School District by incorporating 
<em>FIRST</em> Lego League and FTC in every school. Team 60 has built a great relationship between businesses within the community and its members with many members becoming employees of those sponsors through their apprenticeship programs. Through this connection we have been able to build bridges between the businesses and our team. Our community, though small, has a generous heart and supportive nature assisting with sponsorship over all the years of our existence. Our future, as our students' future, is bright and full of dreams and goals. Co-opertition is not only a 
<em>FIRST</em> concept but one that Team 60 has established within our foundation and our inception. Collaborations over the years with other teams and within the 
<em>FIRST</em> organization have been shown to be not only beneficial but educational. We welcome any questions and offer guidance to those that may have need. We invite you to peruse our website. See what we have to offer and see how you can support our efforts and our program.</strong></p>
