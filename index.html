      <h1>FRC Team 60 - Bionic Bulldogs</h1>
      <p>
        Team 60 is a competitive robotics team based in Kingman Arizona. We
        compete in the FIRST Robotics Competition(FRC). Each year since 1997
        we've designed, built, and programmed a new robot. Our members are high
        school students from Kingman High School, Kingman Academy of Learning
        (KAOL), Lee Williams High School, homeschool, and K-12 Virtual Academy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our Goal: Promote
        <abbr title="Science, Technology, Engineering, Math">STEM</abbr> in our
        community by supporting each FIRST program in our schools. These are
        FIRST Robotics Competition, FIRST Tech Challenge, FIRST Lego League, and
        Lego League Jr.
      </p>

      <h1>What is FIRST?</h1>
      <p>
        For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology, FIRST is a
        portal for K-12 students allowing exploration of the STEM world. It
        helps us find what we like to do. Each year there is a new game and new
        robots to build. But FIRST is more than robots. It is about becoming a
        better person and learning valuable life skills such as teamwork,
        Gracious Professionalism and Coopertition. FIRST is where ingenuity and
        intellect meet to create the hardest fun ever.

      <h1>What is FRC?</h1>
      <p>
        FIRST Robotics Competition is the program for high school students. With
        strict rules, limited resources, and an intense schedule, we create and
        program industrial sized robots for each years game. The robot is
        bigger, playing field larger, and the competition fierce.
